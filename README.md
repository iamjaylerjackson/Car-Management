# Car-Management

Car Management

This is my very first app that I am trying. I hope I do a great job on it.

What I have accomplished so far

Created and configured a Django REST Framework project
Connected the project to a MySQL database and ran migrations
Implemented JWT authentication using Django SimpleJWT
Successfully tested login and protected endpoints using Thunder Client

Challenges faced and how I handled them

Faced issues with HTTP methods and missing authorization headers during testing
Resolved them by using the correct request method (POST) and adding the Authorization header with a Bearer token

3. What’s next

Create core models for the Car Rental system (Cars, Rentals, Payments)
Build CRUD APIs for managing cars
Protect important endpoints using JWT authentication

"username": "info.rsamjackson@gmail.com",
"password": "Password$2025"
}
